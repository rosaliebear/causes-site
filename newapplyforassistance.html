        <li>Signs of animal abuse that are the cause of the animal’s illness or injuries</li>
        <li>Injuries/illnesses that are the result of gross negligence on the part of the client (i.e. walking your dog off lead and he/she gets into a fight causing injuries, etc.)</li>
        <li>Injuries/illnesses that are the result of surgically altering your animal for unnecessary reasons (declawing of cats, clipping dog’s ears/tails, debarking, etc.)</li>

<h1>Below are the requirements for funding approval:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Your pet is required to be spayed or neutered to be considered for a Positive Tails grant. You must agree to have this procedure completed at the time of the treatment you are requesting the grant for, or if your pet is not of age or stable enough, to come back within three months to complete this requirement at the expense of Positive Tails.  Failure to do so will result in the transfer of the entire veterinary bill to your name, and you will be required to refund the funding supplied to you by Positive Tails and VERG of Brooklyn.</li>
  <li>The animal must be a family owned pet with a good history of routine care with a general veterinarian.</li>
  <li>The illness, injury or condition must be a treatable, yet urgent, condition with a good prognosis following treatment.</li>
  <li>The family will be asked to contribute to the remainder of the balance of the treatment, however, VERG will work with each individual and/or family to assure limited financial burden is placed on the client</li>
</ul>

<h2>Once your completed application with supporting paperwork is received, it will be sent to our Granting Committee for review. </h2>
<p>The Granting Committee will make the final decision on approval or denial of your application, and will decide the funding amount. Positive Tails typically has a response within 24 hours of submitting an application to our Granting Committee</p>
