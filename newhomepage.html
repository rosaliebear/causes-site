      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Olaf's Story</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Olaf was found the day after a record-breaking snowstorm frozen in the snow, almost completely lifeless, and with a temperature so low it didn’t even register on a thermometer.  His medical team worked to stabilize this critical patient right away, and against all odds, helped Olaf make a full recovery.  But Olaf’s Positive Tail didn’t end there … one of his doctors fell for him and he is now living the good life with his forever family!</p>
      <hr>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Ganesh's Story</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Ganesh was the victim of a house fire. Ganesh’s apartment went ablaze while him and his family were inside. Luckily everyone got out in time. Ganesh jumped from his 18th floor window. Against all odds, Ganesh survived, but his injuries were extensive and he was going to require multiple surgeries and a very long hospital stay. This is expensive for any family, but especially for Ganesh’s family that had just lost everything in the fire. Their application for Positive Tails was quickly approved and Ganesh began his arduous journey to recovery.  After a long hospital stay and around the clock care, we are happy to say Ganesh and his family are on the road to a full recovery.</p>

      <hr>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Chelsea and Gronk's Story</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">Chelsea was found wandering a construction site with horrible wounds on her chest. These wounds were not only serious, but the result of neglect and abuse by her former owners. Chelsea’s story was re-written when Positive Tails funded the necessary surgeries and hospitalization. While recovering, Chelsea developed a friendship with another abandoned dog, and one Positive Tail became two when they were adopted together!</p>
      <hr>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32">Blue's Story</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">When Blue’s owner came home from work and didn’t hear Blue barking excitedly to say hello, she knew something was wrong. And when she found the fence to the backyard broken with an empty yard, she suspected the worst for her 2 year old Pit Bull. Miraculously, Blue made her way back home after several hours, covered with the tell-tale bruises of being hit by a car, dragging her back leg. A trip to the ER thankfully revealed no immediately life-threatening injuries, but x-rays showed why she was lame – her right femur had been traumatically dislodged from its socket. Even with immediate efforts to try to pop the hip into place, dislocated hips can have a high chance of popping back out due to blood clots in the joint and changes to the anatomy. For her owner with financial hardships, Blue’s future was uncertain. Thankfully, a Positive Tails grant helped fund the cost of a FHO – femoral head ostectomy – a surgery in which the head of the femur – the “ball” of the ball-and-socket apparatus of the hip – was removed. Now, Blue’s hip can’t keep popping in and out of its socket and her leg and thigh muscles are more than enough to keep the joint stable enough for running, jumping, and staying out of trouble!</p>
